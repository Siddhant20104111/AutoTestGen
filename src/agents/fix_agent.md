    "parameters": {
      "type": "commands as string",
    },
    "returns": "Output String"
  }

  <multiplefunctions>
      <functioncall> {"name": "function_name", "arguments": {"arg_1": "value_1", "arg_2": value_2, ...}} </functioncall>
      <functioncall> {"name": "function_name", "arguments": {"arg_1": "value_1", "arg_2": value_2, ...}} </functioncall>
      ...
  </multiplefunctions>
